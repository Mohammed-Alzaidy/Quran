            <h1>Electrical Harmonics in Circuits</h1>
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Electrical harmonics are voltages or currents that operate at a frequency that is an integer
                (whole-number)
                multiple of the fundamental frequency. For example, with a 50Hz fundamental frequency, we can expect
                harmonics
                at 100Hz, 150Hz, 200Hz, and so on. Harmonics are unwanted higher frequencies which superimpose on the
                fundamental waveform creating a distorted wave pattern.</p>

            <p>Harmonics are generated by non-linear loads, which are electrical devices or circuits that have a
                voltage-current
                characteristic that is not linear, that is, the current flowing through them is not proportional to the
                applied
                voltage. Some examples of non-linear loads are iron-cored inductors, switching transformers, electronic
                ballasts
                in fluorescent lights, rectifiers, silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs), power transistors, power
                converters and
                other solid state switches.</p>

            <p>Harmonics can cause various problems in electrical power systems, such as overheating of transformers and
                cables,
                tripping of breakers and fuses, malfunctioning of meters and relays, interference with communication and
                control
                systems, reduction of power factor and efficiency, and increased losses and costs.</p>

            <p>In this article, we will discuss some of the causes and effects of harmonics in electrical circuits, as
                well as
                some methods to measure and mitigate them.</p>

            <h2 id="causes">Causes of Harmonics</h2>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, harmonics are produced by non-linear loads that draw current in abrupt pulses
                rather than
                in a smooth sinusoidal manner. These pulses cause harmonic currents to flow back into other parts of the
                power
                system, creating harmonic voltages across the impedances of the system.</p>

            <p>One common source of harmonics is the rectifier circuit, which converts alternating current (AC) to
                direct
                current (DC). A rectifier circuit consists of diodes that allow current to flow only in one direction.
                When the
                AC voltage is positive, the diodes conduct and charge a capacitor. When the AC voltage is negative, the
                diodes
                block and the capacitor discharges. This results in a pulsating DC voltage with a ripple frequency that
                is twice
                the fundamental frequency.</p>

            <p>The current waveform of a rectifier circuit is shown below.</p>

            <img src="image1.png" alt="Rectifier current waveform">

            <p>As we can see, the current waveform is not sinusoidal but has sharp peaks at regular intervals. This
                means that
                it contains harmonics of higher frequencies than the fundamental frequency. In fact, it can be shown
                mathematically that the current waveform contains only odd harmonics (3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.) and that
                their
                magnitudes decrease as the harmonic order increases.</p>

            <p>Another common source of harmonics is the switching circuit, which uses solid state devices such as
                transistors
                or SCRs to control the power delivered to a load. A switching circuit operates by turning on and off the
                devices
                at high frequencies to create a pulse width modulated (PWM) waveform. The PWM waveform can vary the
                average
                voltage and current delivered to the load by changing the duty cycle (the ratio of on time to off time)
                of the
                pulses.</p>

            <p>The voltage waveform of a switching circuit is shown below.</p>

            <img src="image2.png" alt="Switching voltage waveform">

            <p>As we can see, the voltage waveform is not sinusoidal but has abrupt transitions between high and low
                levels.
                This means that it contains harmonics of higher frequencies than the fundamental frequency. In fact, it
                can be
                shown mathematically that the voltage waveform contains both odd and even harmonics (2nd, 4th, 6th,
                etc.)
                and that their magnitudes depend on the duty cycle and switching frequency.</p>
            <h2 id="effects">Effects of Harmonics</h2>
            <p>Harmonics can have various negative effects on electrical circuits and systems. Some of them are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Overheating</b>: Harmonic currents increase the effective resistance of conductors due to skin
                    effect and
                    proximity effect. Skin effect is the tendency of high frequency currents to flow near the surface of
                    conductors
                    rather than uniformly throughout their cross-section. Proximity effect is the tendency of high
                    frequency
                    currents to flow near each other rather than uniformly throughout their cross-section when they are
                    close
                    together. Both effects increase the power losses and heating in conductors.</li>
                <li><b>Distortion</b>: Harmonic voltages distort the shape of the voltage waveform, which can affect the
                    performance
                    of sensitive equipment such as computers, controllers, meters and relays. Harmonic currents distort
                    the shape of
                    the current waveform, which can increase the harmonic losses and reduce the power factor. Harmonic
                    distortion
                    can also cause resonance in capacitors, transformers and other reactive components, leading to
                    overvoltages and
                    overcurrents that can damage them.</li>
                <li><b>Interference</b>: Harmonics can interfere with communication and control systems that use power
                    lines as
                    transmission media, such as power line carrier (PLC), supervisory control and data acquisition
                    (SCADA), and
                    remote terminal unit (RTU). Harmonics can also interfere with radio and television signals that are
                    transmitted
                    or received near power lines.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="measurement">Measurement of Harmonics</h2>
            <p>Harmonics can be measured using various instruments and methods. Some of them are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Oscilloscope</b>: An oscilloscope can display the voltage or current waveform on a screen and
                    show its shape
                    and amplitude. However, an oscilloscope cannot measure the frequency or magnitude of each harmonic
                    component
                    directly. It can only show the overall distortion of the waveform.</li>
                <li><b>Spectrum Analyzer</b>: A spectrum analyzer can display the frequency spectrum of a voltage or
                    current
                    waveform on a screen and show the magnitude of each harmonic component as a vertical bar. A spectrum
                    analyzer
                    can also measure the total harmonic distortion (THD), which is the ratio of the root mean square
                    (RMS) value of
                    all harmonic components to the RMS value of the fundamental component.</li>
                <li><b>Power Quality Analyzer</b>: A power quality analyzer is a specialized instrument that can measure
                    various
                    parameters related to power quality, such as voltage, current, frequency, power factor, harmonics,
                    flicker,
                    transients, and so on. A power quality analyzer can also record and store data for later analysis.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="mitigation">Mitigation of Harmonics</h2>
            <p>Harmonics can be mitigated using various devices and methods. Some of them are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Harmonic Filter</b>: A harmonic filter is a device that is used to reduce or eliminate harmonics
                    from a power
                    system. A harmonic filter can be either passive or active. A passive harmonic filter consists of
                    passive
                    components such as resistors, capacitors and inductors that are tuned to resonate at one or more
                    harmonic
                    frequencies and provide low impedance paths for harmonic currents to flow to ground. An active
                    harmonic filter
                    consists of active components such as transistors or SCRs that generate harmonic currents that are
                    opposite in
                    phase to the harmonic currents in the power system and cancel them out.</li>
                <li><b>Isolation Transformer</b>: An isolation transformer is a device that transfers electrical energy
                    from one
                    circuit to another without direct electrical connection. An isolation transformer can isolate a load
                    from the
                    source and reduce or eliminate harmonics by providing a high impedance path for harmonic currents to
                    flow back
                    to the source.</li>
                <li><b>Phase Shifting Transformer</b>: A phase shifting transformer is a device that shifts the phase
                    angle of a
                    voltage or current waveform by a certain amount. A phase shifting transformer can reduce or
                    eliminate harmonics
                    by shifting the phase angle of different loads so that their harmonic currents cancel each other out

                <li><b>Power Converter</b>: A power converter is a device that converts one form of electrical energy to
                    another,
                    such as AC to DC, DC to AC, AC to AC, or DC to DC.A power converter can reduce or eliminate
                    harmonics by using advanced switching techniques such as pulse width
                    modulation (PWM), space vector modulation (SVM), or multilevel converters that produce less
                    distorted output waveforms
                    than conventional converters.</li>

                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Electrical harmonics are voltages or currents that operate at higher frequencies than the fundamental frequency of
                    the power system. Harmonics are generated by non-linear loads that draw current in abrupt pulses rather than in a
                    smooth sinusoidal manner. Harmonics can cause various problems in electrical circuits and systems, such as
                    overheating, distortion, interference, and resonance. Harmonics can be measured using instruments such as
                    oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, and power quality analyzers. Harmonics can be mitigated using devices and methods
                    such as harmonic filters, isolation transformers, phase shifting transformers, and power converters.</p>
